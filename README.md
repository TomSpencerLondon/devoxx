## Proposal Ideas
As a mid-level Java developer, these are some topics I might choose that could reflect current trends and advancements in the Java ecosystem:

1. **Adopting Java 21: New Features and Enhancements**
   - Explore the latest features introduced in Java 21, such as pattern matching for switch statements and record patterns, and discuss how they can be leveraged to write more concise and readable code.

2. **Integrating AI and Machine Learning in Java Applications**
   - Demonstrate how to incorporate AI and machine learning capabilities into Java applications using popular libraries and frameworks, enabling intelligent features and data-driven decision-making.

3. **Building Cloud-Native Java Applications**
   - Guide the audience through developing cloud-native applications with Java, focusing on microservices architecture, containerization, and deployment strategies to cloud platforms.

4. **Exploring Project Loom: Lightweight Concurrency in Java**
   - Introduce Project Loom and its approach to lightweight concurrency with virtual threads, and discuss how it simplifies writing scalable concurrent applications in Java.

5. **Enhancing Java Applications with GraalVM**
   - Present the benefits of using GraalVM for Java applications, including improved performance, polyglot capabilities, and native image generation for faster startup times.

6. **Implementing Reactive Programming with Spring WebFlux**
   - Provide an overview of reactive programming principles and demonstrate how to build responsive and resilient applications using Spring WebFlux.

7. **Securing Java Applications: Best Practices and Tools**
   - Discuss common security vulnerabilities in Java applications and share best practices and tools for securing code, managing dependencies, and protecting sensitive data.

8. **Leveraging the Foreign Function & Memory API in Java**
   - Explore the Foreign Function & Memory API introduced in recent Java versions, which facilitates interaction with native code and memory, enhancing performance and interoperability.

9. **Migrating Legacy Java Applications to Modern Frameworks**
   - Share strategies and considerations for migrating legacy Java applications to modern frameworks like Spring Boot or Quarkus, improving maintainability and performance.

10. **Understanding the Java Module System (Project Jigsaw)**
    - Explain the Java Module System introduced in Java 9, its benefits for large applications, and how to create and manage modules effectively.

If I was to create a proposal I would need to write a clear abstract outlining the talk's objectives, the target audience, and key takeaways. 
I would need to tailor my topic to reflect current trends and technologies to enhance its relevance and appeal to conference attendees.

## Preliminary Thoughts
1. Project Loom could be an interesting topic
2. Integrating AI and machine learning might be interesting

### Unique Perspective?
1. Integrating my background in Classics with modern concurrency concepts like Project Loom and Virtual Threads
2. Lessons from Ancient Rome for modern web development. Could explore how ancient Roman engineering principles inform modern web development and concurrency
3. Ancient thinkers like Zeno of Elea and Euclid and their relevance to concepts like concurrency, processes and problem solving in modern computing

#### Further exploration
- Zeno's paradoxes could illustrate infinite processes and convergence which could be related to concurrency challenges
- Modular Design, Robust Architecture and Systematic Planning could illustrate the importance of structured approaches and scalability in software development
- Ancient communication such as Roman roads could inform our understanding of modern data flow and network architecture
- Progression from mechanical computation to modern parallelism showcases how foundational ideas in structured problem solving and resource management evolved into todays concurrency paradigms
